# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 5, 2017 HTML & CSS (FreeCodeCamp)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Creating a demo phone app on free code camp using HTML and CSS. Going through the basics of layout and design.

**Thoughts:** Learning HTML and CSS seems pretty straight-forward. I know I can push myself to get through the first part to get to some more challenging sample projects. I don't really care too much for the automatic correction to my work, but it does teach me a lesson in how to organize and format the code to make it easier to edit.

### Day 2: February 30, 2016 HTML & CSS (FreeCodeCamp)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Learning the basics of HTML & CSS. I learned margin, padding, and I forgot the other because I'm tired. I also worked on strange kitty app.

**Thoughts**: Managing my time has been a challenge. There are so many little things to focus on and distract me from doing real coding work and then I am wondering if I am really doing real coding work since I am learning the very beginning material of coding. I long to do something more challenging, but I know I have to prepare myself for it.

### Day 3: March 9, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML&CSS basics in freecode and moved on to bootstrap.

**Thoughts** I started coding earlier today and didn't not get to post until very late at night. Yet, its okay because I have accomplish a first small step towards understanding some basic code.
