**Today's Progress**: Creating a demo phone app on free code camp using HTML and CSS. Going through the basics of layout and design.

**Thoughts:** Learning HTML and CSS seems pretty straight-forward. I know I can push myself to get through the first part to get to some more challenging sample projects. I don't really care too much for the automatic correction to my work, but it does teach me a lesson in how to organize and format the code to make it easier to edit.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
