# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 5, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Creating a demo phone app on free code camp using HTML and CSS. Going through the basics of layout and design.

**Thoughts:** Learning HTML and CSS seems pretty straight-forward. I know I can push myself to get through the first part to get to some more challenging sample projects. I don't really care too much for the automatic correction to my work, but it does teach me a lesson in how to organize and format the code to make it easier to edit.

### Day 2: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Learning the basics of HTML & CSS. I learned margin, padding, and I forgot the other because I'm tired. I also worked on strange kitty app.

**Thoughts**: Managing my time has been a challenge. There are so many little things to focus on and distract me from doing real coding work and then I am wondering if I am really doing real coding work since I am learning the very beginning material of coding. I long to do something more challenging, but I know I have to prepare myself for it. 

**Link(s) to work**: Not avaliable, too long link. 

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
